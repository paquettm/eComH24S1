Created my repository

Opened that new eComH24S1 folder to work and place my new Web application.

You call your project the way you want.

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "adding instructions"
```

I should normally have to set up my identity on a computer if this was not previously done.

```
git config user.name "Michel Paquette"
```

```
git config user.email "paquettm@vaniercollege.qc.ca"
```

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "adding instructions"

**** fix the problem where I can't push from the school compputers... are there ports that are blocked? ******


## Running the Docker container to host the Web application

Start Docker Desktop first.

Then navigate to your project web root folder (the one containing .htaccess, index.php, and the app folder) and run the following command from the command line:
```
docker run --name myXampp -p 22:22 -p 80:80 -d -v %CD%:/opt/lampp/htdocs tomsik68/xampp
```
The `%CD%` term will automatically be replaced by the Windows environment by the current directory.

## Accessing the project

Open a browser and point it to

```
http://localhost
```

## Bootstrap the project

Create a file called `.htaccess`.
```
Options -MultiViews
Options -Indexes

RewriteEngine On

RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^()$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
```
Copy this file exactly, don't add a single character.

## core folder

holds all the framework core functionality that will not be modified by the programmer/user

The App class is there to call the appropriate Controller class and method for the received HTTP request

## Controllers

Controllers contain the application logic that constitutes the glue between the request (after routing) the models and the views.

To be continued...

## Theory session 2

The following themes were adressed:

- Adding a view method to our Person controller
  - $this
  - calling methods in general and the view method
- Refactoring by moving the view method to a Controller superclass
  - calling the view method again
- Introducing views
  - passing data with parameters and using local variables
  - displaying simple data
  - foreach with sequential and associative arrays

## up next

- Routing 
- Autoloading (See php_guide repo)
- Assignment 1: Static website (to be published)
- Calling a partial view from within a view

## TODO

solve git push problem in room D-241? (Works from Office workstation and D-242.)
